Package: ostree
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: git for operating system binaries
 OSTree is a tool for managing bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem trees.
 While it takes over some of the roles of tradtional "package managers" like
 dpkg and rpm, it is not a package system; nor is it a tool for managing full
 disk images. Instead, it sits between those levels, offering a blend of the
 advantages (and disadvantages) of both.
